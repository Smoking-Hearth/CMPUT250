Beginning:
- Tried all the menu buttons before doing anything else.
- Went down the watchtower ladder rather than jumping off
- Had no problem getttig the firepack on
- Tried to go rightwards instead of where the arrow was pointing
- Still managed to figure out what to do just fine
- No problems deciding to put out the fire.
- The trailblazer killed him in the log, didn't try to go for the vertical exploration
- Used both the water gun and hose a fairly equal amount.
- Tried to put out all the fire
- Used health packs whenever the chance arose
- Tried to put out the fire that could not be put out,
- Made it to the end mostly fine as far as I'm conerned


Feedback (mostly polish stuff):
- "This is good"
- It was unclear: do you kill all the enemies and it lets you through
or you put ou a spawner. Well it's both. Maybe show the player that
the player the fire spawn an enemy, try to make the goal of each piece
a little more obvious.
- Wasn't clear when fighting the boss wether the boss was actually dying.
- Maybe add more variation to the crucible attack patterns, felt like 
player could just sit back and 
- Writing: dispatcher makes the player feel like their doing the wrong thing
beause it felt for like a straight linear thing. "Jarring experience"
- Communicate where the dialog is coming from, idea: radio turn on sound.
- When the radio is hijacked we need to gives some cues that something
different is happening. Particularly for indicating who is speaking.
- We need a polish list
- Good job on the firehydrant comment: "makes the random firehydrants"

Question:
- Is our scope reasonably within reach?
    - How many other bosses?
    - How much more art?
    - Level one duplicated three times is less interesting?
    - For the jump technique make sure we take advantage of it
    for City.
